# This is the pluing's core where all definitions are made.
# When you call the administrate_me class method on a controller all the 
# AdminScaffold methods are added to that controller. Basically this allows you
# to have a full featured table administration on that controller.
# 
# See README file to a step by step guide about how to setup an administrate_me
# application.
# 
# == Callbacks
# 
# There are several callbacks that can be added to you controller to handle 
# features on you app and extend the administrate_me ones.
# 
# ==== general_conditions
# 
# This method is expected to return a +conditions+ value that will be used to 
# narrow down the results of the +index+ action.
#  
# The controller method +get_list+ is in charge to return records for the +index+
# action, even if the request is a search request or an index filter. The +get_list+
# method will always use this general conditions using a +with_scope+ sentence
# to include them on the +find+ method call.
# 
# ==== before_render
# 
# This method will be called on the controller just before the respond_to block
# on every administrate_me action. It can be used to define some extra instance
# variables to use them on the views.
# 
# ==== before_save and after_save
# 
# This methods will be called and after the resource is saved. 
# Be careful about it's use, you should consider as first option to include this
# kind of logic on +before_save+ and +after_save+ callbacks of your model. 
# Just use them when they're really controller related.
